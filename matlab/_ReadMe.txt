The m-files in this folder are generated by FonaDyn
from the template m-files in the "templates" folder. 
They will change so as to follow how FonaDyn is being used. 
Please see the _Instructions.txt in the "templates" folder. 

We suggest that you do not use these files in-place, 
but that you copy them to your Matlab path, 
where you can customize them further as you wish. 

The m-file "runDemos.m" plots a series of examples. 
In that file, set the variable "maindir" to the folder
where you have stored the supplied "Test files". 

The pdf files in this folder are generated 
by different sections in the runDemos.m script.
