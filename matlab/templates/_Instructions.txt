TEMPLATES FOR MATLAB ROUTINES

These m-file templates are modified by FonaDyn, so that a number of FonaDyn's settings 
can become known to Matlab. The settings include:
- The FonaDyn version number
- the size of the voice field: min-max in SPL and semitones
- color mappings for all metrics (to make it easier to adjust the ranges)
- the sequence of metrics stored in Log files, which may change across versions
- the number of metrics stored in Log files - not counting the EGG Fourier Descriptors

Run FonaDyn, and while it is still running, execute the command "FonaDyn.refreshMfiles".
FonaDyn will patch the template files and write the results to the parent directory of this one. 
To specify a different directory, use FonaDyn.refreshMfiles(<targetDirectory>).
 
The FonaDyn_ Matlab routines use two representations of voice maps: 
1. a vrp array similar to the _VRP.csv files, with one row per cell, plus a header row vector of strings
2. a sparse 3D matrix (layers x width x height) for doing matrix operations on maps 

VOICE MAPS
Load a _VRP.csv file into Matlab as a vrp array: 	FonaDynLoadVRP.m
Convert a vrp array into a sparse matrix: 		FonaDynMatrixFromVRP.m
Convert a sparse matrix into a vrp array:		FonaDynVRPFromMatrix.m
Save a vrp array to a .csv text file:			FonaDynSaveVRP.m
Plot a VRP from a vrpArray, many options: 		FonaDynPlotVRP.m
Plot a difference VRP from two vrpArrays: 		FonaDynPlotVRPdiffs.m*
* not yet completely ported to FonaDyn 3.1

LOG FILES
Plot selected metrics over time:			FonaDynPlotLogfile.m
Load a Log file into a 2D array, optionally with	FonaDynLoadLogfile.m
- conversion of EGG metrics using Fourier resynthesis
- conversion of absolute FD's to relative FD's
Make a vrp array AND a sparse matrix from Logfile data:	FonaDynLogfileArrayToVRP.m
Ditto, but fill the outputs with a selected statistic:	FonaDynLogfileArrayStatsToVRP.m
				
EGG WAVEFORMS
Build arrays of resynthesized EGG waveforms		synthEGGfromArrays.m
and also of a struct of EGG metrics from those waveforms.
Plot resynthesized EGG waveforms			plotEGG.m

PHONATION TYPE CENTROID PLOTS
Make a radar plot of the contents of a _cPhon.csv file	plotPolarCentroids.m

COLOR MAPPINGS
The color mappings specified in the Metrics classes of FonaDyn 
are used also to generate colormaps for matlab. 
See the methods VRPMetric.cMap and VRPMetric.cLims. 
You may need to refresh these files if you change 
the number of clusters that you want Matlab to plot. 	FonaDynColors.m, cMapEGG.m, cMapPhon.m

TECH NOTE
The m-file patching is done by an object of the class MfSC (Matlab from SuperCollider), 
which is described in the online help system. You can use MfSC to patch matlab code 
from inside SuperCollider in other projects as well.
